# Wine-Quality
Many people enjoy wine, and as a result, the wine industry is expanding rapidly, especially considering the pandemic, but most of us have no idea what makes a good wine. As a result, we decided to use machine learning models to determine what constitutes high-quality wine, whether red or white

## About
We used different machine learning algorithms in this project to determine which wineâ€™s featured contribute to the quality of wine produced

The main objective of this project is to use Machine Learning algorithms to use the data and be able to classify different wine qualities and determine attributes that are good indicators of wine quality.


The datasets used for analysis and modelling in the project are available in  UCI Machine Learning Repository.
